### Proposed Model Modification: Skill-Augmenting Technology (SAT) Gradient

To create a smoother and more realistic transition into remote work productivity, we propose replacing the hard skill threshold ($h_0$) with a continuous "skill-augmenting technology" gradient. This modification reframes the issue from a binary productivity switch to a smooth function where a worker's ability to be productive remotely is itself a function of their intrinsic skill.

**1. The Economic Story:**

The core assumption is that a worker's intrinsic skill, $h$, does not translate one-to-one into remote productivity. Low-skill workers suffer a significant "productivity penalty" when working remotely, as their skills (e.g., those requiring direct supervision or physical presence) are less transferable. This penalty diminishes as a worker's skill increases, and high-skill workers can deploy their talents almost perfectly in any work arrangement.

**2. The Mathematical Implementation:**

We introduce the concept of **"effective remote skill,"** $h_{\text{remote}}$, which is always less than or equal to a worker's true skill, $h$.

The effective remote skill is defined as:
$$ h_{\text{remote}}(h; \gamma_h) = h \cdot \left(1 - \exp(-\gamma_h \cdot h)\right) $$
Here, $\gamma_h$ is a new parameter to be estimated, representing the **rate of skill transferability** to remote work.

This term is then substituted into the remote efficiency part of the production function, $g(h, \psi)$. The full production function becomes:
$$ Y(\alpha \mid \psi, h; \gamma_h) = (A_0 + A_1 h) \cdot \left((1 - \alpha) + \alpha \cdot \psi_0 \cdot \left[ h_{\text{remote}}(h; \gamma_h) \right]^\phi \cdot \psi^\nu \right) $$

**3. Interpretation of the New Parameter, $\gamma_h$:**

*   **If $\gamma_h$ is estimated to be very large:** The model collapses back to the original specification without a gradient, as `exp(-Î³_h * h)` quickly goes to zero for all but the lowest `h`.
*   **If $\gamma_h$ is estimated to be small and positive:** The model is implementing a smooth gradient. The productivity penalty for remote work is severe for low-skill workers and gradually disappears for high-skill workers.

**4. Advantages of this Approach:**

*   **Replaces a Hard Threshold:** It provides a more plausible and continuous mechanism for why low-skill workers remain in-person.
*   **Solves the "Great Mismatch":** It endogenously creates a sector of workers for whom remote work is highly unproductive, helping the model match the observed high share of in-person work without distorting the preference parameters.
*   **Parsimonious:** It introduces this rich new mechanism with only a single new parameter, $\gamma_h$.
*   **Strengthens Identification:** By providing a better mechanism to match the choice moments (work arrangement shares), it frees up the preference and other production parameters to be more sharply identified by the wage moments.
