# Robustness Checks

Of course. This is the perfect time to consolidate all the potential points of weakness and assumptions we've discussed into a clear, actionable to-do list. This list will form the backbone of your paper's "Robustness Checks" section or appendix, demonstrating the thoroughness of your work.

Here is a summary of the key robustness checks you should perform, organized by the different stages of your project.

### **To-Do List for Robustness Checks**

This list outlines a series of tests to ensure the main findings of the paper are not sensitive to specific methodological choices made during the data construction, model specification, and calibration/estimation phases.

#### **1. Data and Empirical Choices**

The goal here is to verify that your results are not driven by specific data sources or sample selection criteria.

* **[ ] Test the `γ₁` Calibration Method:**
  * **Current Assumption:** `γ₁` is calibrated using an aggregate approximation for state-level hires (`M_it`).
  * **Action/Test:** As a gold-standard check, construct the `M_it` series directly from **CPS microdata** by linking individuals month-to-month. Re-estimate `γ₁` with this more precise measure and re-run your main estimation. The results for your core "Group 2" parameters should be qualitatively similar.

* **[ ] Test the `ψ` Measure:**
  * **Current Assumption:** Your firm remote efficiency measure, `ψ`, is constructed using a specific methodology (e.g., from O*NET or job postings).
  * **Action/Test:** If an alternative measure of remote work potential exists (e.g., from a different data source or a different set of survey questions), construct this alternative `ψ_alt`. Re-run the entire moment generation and estimation process and show that the key parameter estimates (especially `ν` and `ϕ`) are stable.

* **[ ] Test the Sample Selection:**
  * **Current Assumption:** The main analysis is on prime-age (25-54), full-time workers.
  * **Action/Test:** Re-run the moment generation and estimation on an expanded sample that includes younger and older workers, or a sample that includes part-time workers. The core parameter estimates should not change dramatically.

#### **2. Model Specification (Functional Forms)**

This section tests whether your results are sensitive to the specific mathematical forms you chose for the model's components.

* **[ ] Test the Matching Function:**
  * **Current Assumption:** The matching function is Cobb-Douglas: `M = A * U^γ₁ * V^(1-γ₁)`.
  * **Action/Test:** Re-solve and re-estimate the model using a more flexible **CES matching function**. Show that the estimated elasticity of substitution is not statistically different from 1 (which would cause the CES to collapse to the Cobb-Douglas), or that the main parameter estimates are robust to this change.

* **[ ] Test the Skill Distribution:**
  * **Current Assumption:** The worker skill distribution `f(h)` is a Beta distribution.
  * **Action/Test:** Re-estimate the model assuming an alternative flexible distribution, such as a **Log-Normal distribution**. The key economic findings (e.g., the direction and magnitude of the change in preference parameters) should be robust.

#### **3. Calibration Choices (Group 1 Parameters)**

This is the most critical section. It tests the sensitivity of your results to the parameters you chose to *fix* rather than estimate.

* **[ ] Test Worker Bargaining Power (`ξ`):**
  * **Current Assumption:** `ξ` is fixed at a "standard" value (e.g., 0.5).
  * **Action/Test:** This is the most important check. Re-run your entire final estimation twice: once with a **low `ξ` (e.g., 0.3)** and once with a **high `ξ` (e.g., 0.7)**. The core findings of your paper, particularly the estimated changes in the preference and technology parameters, should remain qualitatively unchanged.

* **[ ] Test the Surplus Replacement Rate (`b`):**
  * **Current Assumption:** The value of non-market time, `b`, is calibrated to a specific value (e.g., 0.4).
  * **Action/Test:** Similar to `ξ`, re-run the full estimation with a lower and a higher value for `b` (e.g., `0.3` and `0.5`) to show that your main conclusions are not sensitive to this choice.

* **[ ] Test the Separation Rate (`δ`):**
  * **Current Assumption:** `δ` is calibrated directly from the JOLTS Layoffs and Discharges rate.
  * **Action/Test:** Re-run the estimation using the **Quits rate** or the **Total Separations rate** from JOLTS to define `δ`. This tests whether your results are sensitive to the specific definition of job separation.

#### **4. Estimation Strategy**

This section tests the sensitivity of your results to the specific moments you chose to target.

* **[ ] Test Alternative Identifying Moments:**
  * **Current Assumption:** You have a specific mapping from parameters to moments (e.g., `ϕ` is identified by `diff_alpha_high_lowpsi`).
  * **Action/Test:** For one or two key parameters, swap in the alternative moment we identified during the sensitivity analysis. For example, re-estimate the model using the **`ratio_var_logwage`** moment to identify `ϕ` instead of the `diff_alpha` moment. The resulting estimate for `ϕ` should be reasonably close to your baseline result.

* **[ ] Test the Moment Weighting:**
  * **Current Assumption:** Your main estimation uses an identity matrix for the SMM weighting matrix (`W=I`).
  * **Action/Test:** Re-run the final local optimization (BFGS) using a **diagonally weighted matrix**, where the weights are the inverse of the variance of each moment in the data. This is a standard GMM robustness check. The parameter estimates should be stable.
