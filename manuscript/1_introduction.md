# Introduction 

he COVID-19 pandemic reshaped the landscape of work almost overnight, catapulting remote and hybrid work arrangements from niche to mainstream. By 2024, nearly 30% of U.S. workdays were performed remotely—over four times the pre-pandemic share (\textcolor{green}{Barrero, Bloom, and Davis, 2023}). This dramatic shift presents a puzzle: while remote work is clearly valued by workers, it has not led to a universal wage penalty, and the productivity implications remain ambiguous.

Our research question is straightforward: to what extent did the recent "great re-valuation" of remote work stem from shifts in worker preferences versus advances in technology? And how does the pattern of matching between workers and firms help explain the observed patterns in wages and work arrangements?

To answer these questions, we develop and estimate a general equilibrium search model with heterogeneity in worker skills, firm remote-work efficiency, and idiosyncratic worker tastes. A key innovation of our empirical approach is a novel, continuous measure of occupational teleworkability, which we construct using machine learning techniques. This index allows for a more nuanced identification of firm-level remote efficiency and sorting patterns than the binary measures used in prior work \textcolor{green}{CITE}. We estimate the model’s parameters using the Simulated Method of Moments (SMM) on rich microdata from 2019 and 2024 to quantify the relative contributions of preference and technology shocks. Our estimates reveal that the primary driver of the shift to remote work has been

**Case 1: Preferences Dominate**

\textcolor{red}{a profound re-valuation of in-office time by workers. We estimate a $X\%$ increase in the parameter governing the disutility of commuting and in-office presence, an effect that is over $N$ times larger than the concurrent $Y\%$ increase we estimate in the parameter for remote work technology. This indicates that the "great re-valuation" is fundamentally a story about evolving worker preferences, which reshaped the equilibrium sorting of workers to firms and the resulting wage and work arrangements.}

**Case 2: Technology Dominates**

\textcolor{blue}{a significant technological shock that enhanced the viability of remote work. We estimate a $X\%$ increase in the parameter governing the relative productivity of remote technology, an effect that is over $N$ times larger than the modest $Y\%$ shift we estimate in the parameter for worker preferences. This suggests that the "great re-valuation" is fundamentally a story about technological adoption, which reshaped the equilibrium sorting of workers to firms and the resulting wage and work arrangements.}

<!-- - [ ] **Hook:** Start with the significance of the post-pandemic shift to remote/hybrid work.
- [ ] **The Puzzle:** Frame the core debate: was this shift driven by a technology shock or a preference shock?
- [ ] **Our Contribution:** Introduce the structural search model with its three key heterogeneity dimensions.
    - [ ] **TODO:** "Our framework nests a tractable, deterministic model that provides sharp analytical insights, which we then extend to a full stochastic model with idiosyncratic preferences. This allows us to both build clear economic intuition and match the rich heterogeneity observed in the data."
