# Identification Strategy

The parameters are divided into two groups. The first group consists of parameters that are set externally, based on standard values in the literature or straightforward calculations from aggregate data. The second group contains the core parameters that are estimated jointly to match a set of key moments that characterize the labor market in each period.

## **Group 1: Externally Calibrated Parameters**

These parameters are generally considered to be stable structural parameters or are easily pinned down from aggregate statistics.  The following table summarizes these parameters along with their values for 2019 and 2024.

| Parameter  | Description               | Source/Target                                                                                                | 2019 Value | 2024 Value |
| :--------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| $\beta$    | Discount Factor           | Matches a 5% annual real interest rate. Standard in macro models (Lise and Robin, 2017; Bagga et al., 2024). | 0.996      | 0.996      |
| $\gamma_0$ | Matching Efficiency       | Set to 1 as a normalization. The level of matching is absorbed by other parameters, primarily vacancy costs. | 1.0        | 1.0        |
| $\gamma_1$ | Matching Elasticity       | Common value in the search and matching literature (Petrongolo and Pissarides, 2001).                        | 0.5        | 0.5        |
| $\xi$      | Worker Bargaining Power   | Standard value implying equal surplus sharing (Shimer, 2005).                                                | 0.5        | 0.5        |
| $\delta$   | Exogenous Separation Rate | Matches the average monthly Layoffs and Discharges rate, calculated from JOLTS data for the target year.     | 0.012      | 0.011      |
| $\kappa_1$ | Vacancy Cost Convexity    | Imposes a standard quadratic cost function, $c(v)=\frac{\kappa_0}{2}v^{2}$                                   | 1.0        | 1.0        |

## **Group 2: Internally Estimated Parameters**

These parameters are estimated jointly for each period (2019 and 2024) using the Simulated Method of Moments (SMM). The goal is to choose the parameter values that minimize the distance between moments generated by the model and their counterparts in the data for each specific year. This allows us to see which parameters have changed following the pandemic.

### **Worker Skill $(h)$ Distribution**

-   **Functional Form Assumption:** Following Lise and Robin (2017), we assume a flexible parametric form for the unobserved distribution of worker skill. Specifically, worker skill $h$ is assumed to be drawn from a Beta distribution with shape parameters $a_h > 0$ and $b_h > 0$:
    $$h \sim \text{Beta}(a_h, b_h)$$

-   **Identification Rationale:** The parameters ($a_h, b_h$) are identified by matching the moments of the unconditional wage distribution in the model to the data. The shape of the skill distribution is the primary source of wage dispersion in the model. A distribution of $h$ with a higher mean will raise the average wage, while a higher variance in $h$ will, all else equal, increase wage inequality.

    -   **Moment 1: Average Wage Level:** This moment pins down the central tendency of the skill distribution.
        -   **Data Moment:** The sample mean of log hourly wages for all employed workers in the target year.
            $$\text{Moment}_1^{\text{Data}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \log(w_i)$$
        -   **Model Counterpart:** The theoretical expectation of log wages in the model's steady state. This is calculated by integrating over the equilibrium distribution of employed workers, $n(h, \psi)$, and the conditional distribution of work arrangements, $p(\alpha \mid h, \psi)$.
            $$\text{Moment}_1^{\text{Model}}(a_h, b_h, \dots) = \iint \Exp_{\alpha}[\log(w(h, \psi; \alpha))] n(h, \psi) \,dF_h \,dF_\psi$$

    -   **Moment 2: Wage Inequality:** This moment pins down the dispersion of the skill distribution.
        -   **Data Moment:** The sample variance of log hourly wages for all employed workers in the target year.
            $$\text{Moment}_2^{\text{Data}} = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (\log(w_i) - \overline{\log(w)})^2$$
        -   **Model Counterpart:** The theoretical variance of log wages in the model's steady state.
            $$\text{Moment}_2^{\text{Model}}(a_h, b_h, \dots) = \Exp\left[ (\log(w^*) - \Exp[\log(w^*)])^2 \right]$$

    -   **Joint Identification:** The mean and variance of the Beta distribution are known functions of its shape parameters:
        $$\Exp[h] = \frac{a_h}{a_h + b_h} \quad \text{and} \quad \text{Var}(h) = \frac{a_h b_h}{(a_h + b_h)^2 (a_h + b_h + 1)}$$
        While the mapping from these theoretical moments of $h$ to the moments of the log wage distribution is complex, the intuition is direct. The SMM estimator will adjust $a_h$ and $b_h$ to find the unique shape of the skill distribution that, when filtered through the model's sorting, choice, and wage-setting mechanisms, best replicates the observed mean and variance of wages. Even in the continuous logit model, where wages depend on the chosen $\alpha$, the fundamental driver of a worker's productivity and surplus-generating potential remains their skill $h$, preserving this identification channel. For example, to match a high level of wage inequality (a high $\text{Var}(\log(w))$), the estimator will need to choose $a_h$ and $b_h$ that imply a high $\text{Var}(h)$.

### **In-Office Cost and Preference Heterogeneity ($c_{0}$, $\chi$, $\mu$)**

These three parameters jointly define worker preferences over work arrangements. The deterministic part of the in-office disutility is specified by the function $c(1-\alpha) = c_{0} \frac{(1-\alpha)^{1+\chi}}{1+\chi}$, while $\mu$ governs the scale of idiosyncratic taste shocks around this baseline. While they are estimated together, they are identified by distinct features of the data:
-   $c_{0}$ governs the overall **scale** or average "price" of the remote work amenity.
-   $\chi$ governs the **curvature** of the cost, which shapes the incentives for corner vs. interior solutions.
-   $\mu$ governs the **dispersion** of preferences, which determines how much choices deviate from the deterministic optimum.

To separately identify these three parameters, we require three distinct moments that are uniquely sensitive to each one.

-   **Identification of the Scale Parameter ($c_{0}$)**: The scale parameter $c_{0}$ is primarily identified by the **average compensating wage differential** between in-person and remote work. It directly scales the monetary compensation a worker receives for the disutility of their chosen work arrangement.
    *   **Mechanism:** In the continuous logit model, the wage paid to a worker in a match $(h, \psi)$ who has chosen arrangement $\alpha$ is:
        $$w(h, \psi; \alpha) = \underbrace{\text{Base Wage}(h, \psi)}_{\text{From surplus split}} + \underbrace{c_{0} \frac{(1-\alpha)^{1+\chi}}{1+\chi}}_{\text{Compensation for in-office disutility}}$$
        The "Base Wage" component depends on the total expected surplus. The second term is the compensating differential. The average observed wage gap between groups is therefore a direct reflection of the average compensation paid, which is scaled by $c_{0}$.
    *   **Identification Argument:** Holding the distribution of choices constant, a larger observed wage premium for in-person work requires a larger $c_{0}$ for the model to generate the necessary compensation. While the choice of $\alpha$ is itself endogenous, $c_{0}$ remains the primary parameter governing the magnitude of this wage-arrangement relationship.
    *   **Data Moment:** The estimated coefficient, $\hat{\beta}_2$, from a Mincer-style wage regression with dummy variables for work arrangements, where "Fully Remote" is the omitted reference category:
        $$\log(w_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \mathbf{I}(\text{Hybrid}_i) + \beta_2 \mathbf{I}(\text{In-Person}_i) + \mathbf{X}_i'\Gamma + \varepsilon_i$$
    *   **Model Counterpart:** The analogous regression coefficient, $\hat{\beta}_{2, \text{sim}}$, estimated from a large cross-section of simulated data generated by the model.

-   **Identification of the Curvature Parameter ($\chi$)**: The curvature parameter $\chi$ is primarily identified by the **share of workers in corner solutions, specifically the share that is fully remote ($\alpha = 1$)**. It determines how quickly the marginal disutility of in-office work changes, thereby shaping the desirability of full vs. partial remote work.
    *   **Mechanism:** A high $\chi$ makes the deterministic value function $V(h, \psi; \alpha)$ highly convex in $\alpha$ (as a function of in-office time $1-\alpha$). This creates a strong incentive to "snap" to a corner solution. For matches where remote work is productive ($g(h, \psi) > 1$), a high $\chi$ makes the final step from $\alpha=0.99$ to $\alpha = 1$ very attractive.
    *   **Identification Argument:** The model's predicted share of workers who choose $\alpha = 1$ is highly sensitive to $\chi$. While other parameters influence *which* matches are candidates for remote work, $\chi$ has a disproportionate effect on whether those candidates choose a full or partial arrangement. To match a large observed share of fully remote workers, the estimation must select a high value for $\chi$.
    *   **Data Moment:** The share of the employed workforce in fully remote work arrangements.
    *   **Model Counterpart:** The share of simulated workers in the model's steady state for whom the drawn work arrangement $\alpha$ is equal to 1 (or within a small tolerance, e.g., $\alpha > 0.95$).

-   **Identification of the Taste Dispersion Parameter ($\mu$)**: The scale parameter $\mu$ is primarily identified by the **share of workers in hybrid arrangements**. It determines the degree of randomness in choices, and therefore the prevalence of interior solutions that deviate from the deterministic corners.
    *   **Mechanism:** The deterministic value function $V(h, \psi; \alpha)$ is often bimodal (with peaks at $\alpha = 0$ and $\alpha = 1$). In the absence of taste shocks ($\mu=0$), all choices would be at these corners. The parameter $\mu$ "smears out" these choices. A larger $\mu$ implies more significant taste shocks, making it more likely that a worker will choose an interior "hybrid" $\alpha$ even if the deterministic optimum is at a corner.
    *   **Identification Argument:** The model's predicted share of workers in hybrid arrangements is highly sensitive to $\mu$. To match a large observed share of hybrid workers in the data, the estimation must select a high value for $\mu$, indicating significant preference heterogeneity.
    *   **Data Moment:** The share of the employed workforce in hybrid work arrangements.
    *   **Model Counterpart:** The share of simulated workers in the model's steady state for whom the drawn work arrangement $\alpha$ is an interior solution (e.g., $0.05 < \alpha < 0.95$).
    *   **TODO:** "The Gumbel scale parameter $\mu$ is strongly identified by the variance of remote work ($var_\alpha$), as shown in its sharp likelihood profile (Figure B.X). The estimated value of $\mu$ is an empirical measure of the importance of idiosyncratic preferences. It quantifies how 'blurry' the decision margins are in the real world, telling us how far the true data generating process is from the simplified, deterministic benchmark."

**Joint Identification:** The parameters $c_{0}$, $\chi$, and $\mu$ are disentangled by targeting three distinct moments:
1.  The **wage gap** between remote and in-person workers identifies the scale of the amenity value, $c_{0}$.
2.  The **share of fully remote workers** identifies the preference curvature, $\chi$, which drives corner solutions.
3.  The **share of hybrid workers** identifies the taste dispersion, $\mu$, which drives interior solutions.
-   By forcing the model to match the "price" (wage gap), the "corner quantity" (full remote share), and the "interior quantity" (hybrid share) simultaneously, the estimator can separately identify the scale $c_{0}$, the curvature $\chi$, and the dispersion $\mu$.

### **Production Function ($\psi_{0}$, $\phi$, $\nu$)**

These parameters jointly determine the output of a worker-firm match. Their identification relies on the wage distribution and the distribution of work arrangements, conditional on firm and worker types.

**Remote Productivity Parameters ($\psi_{0}$, $\nu$)**
These parameters govern the level and dispersion of remote work productivity.
-   **Mechanism:** These parameters enter the production function via the relative remote productivity term, $g(h, \psi) = \psi_0 \exp(\nu\psi + \phi h)$. This term shapes the deterministic value function $V(h, \psi; \alpha)$ and, consequently, the flow surplus $s(h, \psi)$ and the total surplus $S(h, \psi)$. Since the wage is an increasing function of the surplus, the properties of $g(h, \psi)$ directly map to the properties of wages.

-   **Identification Argument:**

    1.  **Firm-Remote Complementarity ($\nu$):** This elasticity is identified by the **slope of the wage-efficiency profile**, which we measure in the data by the **correlation between firm efficiency $\psi$ and wages**. Formally, the parameter $\nu$ directly scales the sensitivity of the flow surplus, $s(h, \psi)$, to changes in $\psi$. A steeper observed wage profile in the data therefore requires a higher $\nu$ in the model to generate a sufficiently strong surplus response. (A formal proof is provided in Appendix \textcolor{green}{Rigorous Justification for the Wage-Efficiency Profile}).
        -   **Data Moment:** The estimated coefficient, $\hat{\beta}_1$, from a Mincer-style wage regression that estimates the semi-elasticity of wages with respect to the firm's remote work efficiency, $\psi$, after controlling for observable worker characteristics:
            $$\log(w_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \psi_{i} + \mathbf{X}_i'\Gamma + \varepsilon_i$$
        -   **Model Counterpart:** The analogous regression coefficient, $\hat{\beta}_{1, \text{sim}}$, estimated from a large cross-section of simulated data generated by the model.

    2.  **Remote Productivity Scale ($\psi_{0}$):** Given the slope $\nu$, the scale $\psi_{0}$ is identified by the **average wage premium** of high-$\psi$ firms over low-$\psi$ firms. This moment pins down the overall level of the remote productivity advantage.
        -   **Mechanism:** The parameter $\psi_{0}$ acts as a level shifter on the relative productivity term $g(h, \psi)$. This directly scales the flow surplus $s(h, \psi)$ and, consequently, the average wage for any given $\psi$. The parameter $\nu$ determines *how much steeper* the wage-$\psi$ profile is, while $\psi_{0}$ shifts the entire profile up or down.
        -   **Identification:** To match a large average wage premium in the data for high-$\psi$ firms, the estimator must choose a sufficiently large $\psi_{0}$ to scale up the productivity advantage of these firms.
        -   **Data Moment:** The estimated **average wage premium** for firms with high remote-work efficiency, controlling for worker characteristics. This is captured by the coefficient on a dummy variable in a Mincer-style wage regression:
            $$\log(w_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \mathbf{I}(\psi_i \in \text{High}) + \mathbf{X}_i'\Gamma + \varepsilon_i$$
        -   **Model Counterpart:** The analogous regression coefficient, $\hat{\beta}_{1, \text{sim}}$, estimated from a large cross-section of simulated data generated by the model.

**Skill-Remote Complementarity ($\phi$)**
This is a key parameter of interest, determining whether worker skill and firm remote technology are complements or substitutes.
-   **Mechanism:** The parameter $\phi$ governs the **cross-partial derivative** of the deterministic value function, which determines the nature of sorting in the market.
    $$ \frac{\partial^2 V(h, \psi; \alpha)}{\partial h \partial \psi} \propto \phi $$
    -   If **$\phi > 0$ (Complements)**, high-skill workers are disproportionately more productive in high-$\psi$ firms, creating gains from **positive assortative matching**.
    -   If **$\phi < 0$ (Substitutes)**, high-skill workers' advantage is diminished in high-$\psi$ firms, creating gains from **negative assortative matching**.
-   **Identification Argument:** The parameter $\phi$ is identified by the **sorting pattern between worker skill $h$ and firm efficiency $\psi$**. We use the conditional distribution of work arrangements as the primary identifying moment.
    -   **The Logic:** Sorting not only affects wages but also the **distribution of chosen work arrangements**. The probability of choosing a high $\alpha$ is increasing in the deterministic value $V(h, \psi; \alpha)$.
        -   If **$\phi > 0$ (Complements)**, high-$h$ workers sort into high-$\psi$ firms. In these matches, the term $g(h, \psi)$ is particularly large, making the deterministic value of remote work high. This pushes the entire probability distribution $p(\alpha \mid h,\psi)$ to the right, increasing the average chosen $\alpha$.
        -   Therefore, $\phi$ is identified by how the **average share of remote work, $\Exp[\alpha]$, differs across firms with high and low $\psi$**.
    -   **The Data Moment:** We compute the average share of remote work (e.g., average days worked from home) for workers in high-$\psi$ firms and low-$\psi$ firms and take the difference:
        $$\text{Moment}_{\text{Data}} = \Exp[\alpha \mid \psi \in \text{High Quantile}] - \Exp[\alpha \mid \psi \in \text{Low Quantile}]$$
    -   **The Model Counterpart:** We simulate the model and compute the same conditional difference in the average drawn $\alpha$.


### **Search & Matching**

*   **Vacancy Cost Scale ($\kappa_0$):** This parameter governs the overall cost of posting vacancies and is the primary determinant of the number of vacancies firms create in equilibrium.
    *   **Mechanism:** The parameter $\kappa_0$ directly scales the cost of vacancy creation. As shown in the model's derivation, the equilibrium labor market tightness, $\theta$, is a decreasing function of $\kappa_0$.
    *   **Identification Argument:** $\kappa_0$ is identified by matching the model's equilibrium market tightness to the data. The estimator adjusts $\kappa_0$ until the model's implied $\theta$ matches its empirical counterpart.
    *   **Data Moment:** The average **vacancy-to-unemployment ratio (V/U)** for the target year, constructed from JOLTS and CPS data.
    *   **Model Counterpart:** The value of $\theta$ calculated from the model's closed-form solution for a given set of parameters.

### Rigorous Justification for the Wage-Efficiency Profile


This appendix formally shows that the sensitivity of the expected wage with respect to firm remote efficiency $\psi$ is directly and monotonically related to the parameter $\nu$, justifying the use of the wage-$\psi$ slope as the primary identifying moment for $\nu$.

**Step 1: The Effect of $\psi$ on the Flow Surplus $s(h, \psi)$**

The flow surplus is defined by the "inclusive value" or "log-sum-exp" formula:
$$ s(h, \psi) = \mu \ln \left( \int_0^1 \exp\left(\frac{V(h, \psi; \alpha)}{\mu}\right) d\alpha \right) - b(h) $$
To find the sensitivity to $\psi$, we differentiate with respect to $\psi$. The derivative of the log-sum-exp term is a standard result in random utility theory, yielding the expectation of the derivative of the inner term:
$$ \frac{\partial s(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi} = \int_0^1 p(\alpha \mid h, \psi) \frac{\partial V(h, \psi; \alpha)}{\partial \psi} d\alpha = \mathbb{E}_{\alpha} \left[ \frac{\partial V(h, \psi; \alpha)}{\partial \psi} \right] $$
The derivative of the deterministic value $V(\alpha) = Y(\alpha) - c(1-\alpha)$ with respect to $\psi$ is:
$$ \frac{\partial V(h, \psi; \alpha)}{\partial \psi} = \frac{\partial Y(\alpha)}{\partial \psi} = A_1 h \cdot \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial g(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi} $$
Substituting the functional form $g(h, \psi) = \psi_0 \exp(\nu\psi + \phi h)$, we have $\frac{\partial g}{\partial \psi} = g(h, \psi) \cdot \nu$.
$$ \frac{\partial V(h, \psi; \alpha)}{\partial \psi} = A_1 h \cdot \alpha \cdot g(h, \psi) \cdot \nu $$
Plugging this back into the expression for the derivative of the flow surplus:
$$ \frac{\partial s(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi} = \int_0^1 p(\alpha \mid h, \psi) \left( A_1 h \cdot \alpha \cdot g(h, \psi) \cdot \nu \right) d\alpha $$
$$ \frac{\partial s(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi} = \underbrace{\left( A_1 h \cdot g(h, \psi) \cdot \nu \right)}_{>0} \cdot \underbrace{\Exp[\alpha \mid h, \psi]}_{>0} $$
This shows that the sensitivity of the *flow surplus* to firm efficiency $\psi$ is directly and positively proportional to $\nu$.

**Step 2: The Effect on Total Surplus $S(h, \psi)$ and the Expected Wage $\Exp[w]$**

1.  **From Flow to Total Surplus:** The Bellman equation for the total surplus is:
    $$ S(h, \psi) = \frac{s(h, \psi) - \text{Continuation Value}}{1 - \beta(1 - \delta)} $$
    Differentiating with respect to $\psi$ (and holding the aggregate continuation value term constant, as it depends on the expectation over all $\psi'$):
    $$ \frac{\partial S(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi} = \frac{1}{1 - \beta(1 - \delta)} \frac{\partial s(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi} $$
    The sensitivity of the total surplus is a discounted amplification of the sensitivity of the flow surplus. Therefore, $\frac{\partial S(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi} \propto \nu$.

1.  **From Total Surplus to the Expected Wage:** The wage for a chosen $\alpha$ is $w(\alpha) = \text{Base Wage} + c(1-\alpha)$. The Base Wage component is an increasing function of the total surplus $S(h, \psi)$. The expected wage is:
    $$ \mathbb{E}[w \mid h, \psi] = \text{Base Wage}(S(h, \psi)) + \mathbb{E}[c(1-\alpha) \mid h, \psi] $$
    The dominant channel through which $\psi$ affects the expected wage is via its effect on the total surplus $S(h, \psi)$. A higher $\nu$ leads to a much larger surplus $S(h, \psi)$ in high-$\psi$ firms, and this larger surplus must be shared with the worker, leading to a higher Base Wage. While the expected compensation term also adjusts, the primary driver of the wage-$\psi$ profile is the surplus channel.

**Conclusion:** The semi-elasticity of the expected wage with respect to $\psi$ is a positive and monotonic function of $\nu$. This provides a rigorous justification for using the slope of the wage-efficiency profile as the identifying moment for $\nu$.

    -   [ ] **Write the Narrative:** For each key parameter, briefly explain how the corresponding plot demonstrates its link to its primary identifying moment. (e.g., "Figure B.X shows the strong, monotonic relationship between the vacancy cost $\kappa_0$ and market tightness, confirming our choice of this moment...").
