# **Conclusion**

-   [ ] **Restate the Core Question:** Briefly remind the reader of the central puzzle: What drove the massive and persistent rise of remote work post-pandemic?
-   [ ] **Summarize the Method:** Concisely describe the structural search model with its key heterogeneity dimensions and the SMM estimation strategy.
-   [ ] **State the Main Finding:** Deliver the punchline clearly and confidently. The "Great Re-Valuation" in worker preferences was the dominant force, dwarfing the impact of technological improvements.
-   [ ] **Discuss the Implications:**
    -   [ ] **For the Future of Work:** The shift is likely permanent because it is rooted in a fundamental change in preferences, not just a temporary adaptation to a new technology.
    -   [ ] **For Firms:** Competition for talent now explicitly involves offering flexibility as a key part of the compensation bundle.
    -   [ ] **For Urban Economics:** Discuss the potential long-run effects on commercial real estate, residential location choices, and the economic geography of cities.
-   [ ] **Acknowledge Limitations:** Briefly mention any simplifying assumptions. (e.g., "Our model abstracts from on-the-job search and general equilibrium effects on the housing market...").
-   [ ] **Suggest Future Work:** Propose extensions based on the limitations. (e.g., "Future work could incorporate a dynamic model of on-the-job search to study how flexibility affects career ladders...").
