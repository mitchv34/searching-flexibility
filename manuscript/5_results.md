# Results

- [ ] **5.1. Parameter Estimates:**
    - [ ] Insert the main table of estimated parameters for 2019 and 2024.
    - [ ] Discuss the statistical significance of the changes.
- [ ] **5.2. The Anatomy of the "Great Re-Valuation":**
    - [ ] Interpret the large change in $c_0$ in monetary terms.
    - [ ] Contrast this with the smaller changes in technology parameters ($\nu$, $\psi_0$).
    - [ ] Discuss the implications of the changes in $\xi$ and $\phi$.
- [ ] **5.3. Model Fit:**
    - [ ] Insert the table comparing data moments to simulated moments.
    - [ ] Discuss how well the model replicates the stylized facts from Section 2.
- [ ] **In the subsection where you present your new visualizations:** 
    - [ ] **TODO:** When presenting the **"S-Curve" plot of $E[\alpha]$**, write: "As shown in Figure X, the model generates a smooth S-shaped relationship between firm efficiency and the expected remote share. The 'liftoff' and 'saturation' points of these curves correspond closely to the analytical thresholds derived in our deterministic benchmark (Section 3.2), illustrating how preference heterogeneity smooths the sharp predictions of the simpler model."
    - [ ] **TODO:** When presenting the **"Heatmap of $\text{Var}(\alpha)$"**, write: "Figure Y visualizes the heterogeneity of choice across the equilibrium. The bright diagonal ridge, indicating high variance in work arrangements, is centered precisely in the 'hybrid' region defined by the deterministic thresholds, $\underline{\psi}(h)$ and $\overline{\psi}(h)$."
