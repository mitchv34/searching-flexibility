"""
SearchingFlexibility
--------------------
Lightweight package entry for this project. Source files are organized under
`src/structural_model` and `src/structural_model_new`. Scripts may include
those files directly as needed. Keeping this module minimal allows successful
precompilation without eagerly loading heavy submodules.
