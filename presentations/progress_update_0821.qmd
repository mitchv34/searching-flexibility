# Introduction

## Project Status: Significant Progress

**High-Level Summary:** The structural model is built, numerically stable, and shows strong identification. We are ready to move from development and testing to the main estimation phase.

**Key Achievements:**

-   **Model Built & Solved:** A rich search and matching model with heterogeneous agents and continuous remote work choice.
-   **Solver Optimized:** The solver is now highly efficient (low memory allocation) and robust (handles difficult parameter regions).
-   **Identification Confirmed:** Extensive likelihood profiling and sensitivity analysis confirm that all key structural parameters are well-identified by observable moments.
-   **Plausible Baseline Calibrated:** The model has been calibrated to a baseline that is numerically stable and operates in an economically plausible regime.

## Expanded Research Question: Preferences vs. Technology

The project's scope has evolved from a narrow focus on wage gaps to a broader, more fundamental question.

**Initial Focus:**

- What is the compensating wage differential for remote work?

**Expanded Scope:**

- What were the fundamental drivers of the post-pandemic shift in work arrangements? We aim to disentangle two primary forces:
    1.  **A Preference Shock:** Did workers' valuation of the remote work amenity fundamentally increase?
    2.  **A Technology Shock:** Did remote work become significantly more productive?

## Expanded Research Question: Preferences vs. Technology

**Key Questions We Can Now Answer:**

- How did the **average** preference for remote work ($c_0$) and the **diversity** of those preferences ($\mu$) change from 2019 to 2024?
- How much did the **relative productivity** of remote work ($\psi_0, \nu$) actually improve?
- Did the **relationship between skill and remote technology** ($\phi$) change, altering sorting patterns in the labor market?

## The Model at a Glance: Key Mechanisms

We use a structural search model to create a "digital twin" of the U.S. labor market, allowing us to measure the unobservable forces driving agent decisions.

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Who is in the economy?**

-   **Workers:**
    -   Heterogeneous in skill ($h$).
    -   Have idiosyncratic preferences for remote (Gumbel shock).

-   **Firms:**
    -   Heterogeneous in remote efficiency ($\psi$).

-   **The Market:**
    -   A frictional (random) search market.

**What are their key decisions?**

-   **Worker-Firm Pair ($\alpha$):**
    -   Jointly choose the optimal share of remote work ($\alpha$).
    -   Decision is driven by the trade-off between **productivity** and **amenity value** of remote.

-   **Firms:**
    -   Post vacancies based on free entry conditions.

-   **Wages:**
    -   Determined by bargaining ($\xi$) and include a compensating differential.

## Estimation Strategy: Matching the Model to the Data

We estimate the model by forcing it to replicate key features of the U.S. labor market in two distinct periods: 2019 and 2024.

**Overall Approach:** Simulated Method of Moments (SMM)

1.  **Establish Empirical Facts:** We construct a set of 9-10 key data moments that characterize the labor market in each period (e.g., wage levels, remote work shares, sorting patterns, market tightness).
2.  **Find the Parameters:** We use a global search algorithm to find the set of structural parameters that allows the model to best replicate these empirical facts.
3.  **Compare the Periods:** The core of the analysis is comparing the estimated parameter vectors ($\theta_{2019}$ vs. $\theta_{2024}$) to identify the structural changes in the economy.

## Estimation Strategy: Matching the Model to the Data

**Identification is Confirmed:** Our sensitivity analysis (see Appendix plots) confirms that our chosen moments are highly informative about the key parameters.

| **Data Moments Related To...** | **Inform...**                               |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Wages & Productivity           | Skill Distribution & Technology ($a_h, b_h, A_1$)  |
| Work Arrangements              | Preferences ($c_0, \mu, \chi$)                    |
| Sorting Patterns               | Remote Tech & Complementarity ($\nu, \phi$)      |
| Market Frictions               | Search Costs & Bargaining ($\kappa_0, \xi$)         |

## Next Steps: A 10-Day Plan to Preliminary Results

- **1: Large-Scale Global Search (Days 1-4)**

- **2: Final SMM Estimation (Days 5-8)**
  -   **Task:** Launch the final, precise SMM estimation using a local optimizer (e.g., BFGS), starting from the best vector found in Phase 1.
    -   **Goal:** Obtain the final parameter estimates and their standard errors for both the 2019 and 2024 periods.
- **3: Preliminary Analysis & Results (Days 9-10)**
  -   **Task:** Analyze the differences in the estimated parameter vectors between the two periods. Run model fit checks.
